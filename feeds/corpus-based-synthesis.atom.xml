&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History of granular synthesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granular synthesis is a sound synthesis technique derived from what was
originally suggested by Iannis Xenakis as a compositional method on his book
&lt;em&gt;Musiques Formelles&lt;/em&gt; (1981). Due to its inherent complexity, it was
successfully implemented for the first time on software by Curtis Roads on 1991
and by Barry Truax on 1988. Later on, Curtis Roads would give a conceptual
framework to this technique, rooted on science, going as back as Gabor's
experiments with sound quanta on his book Microsound (2004). As well as
explaining the basis of this method of sound design, the author gathers an
exhaustive compendium of all software implementations using granular synthesis.
Though today this catalog may seem dated, this book is a corner stone on this
particular subject and the reader will probably find it inspirational as well
as informative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As its name suggests, granular synthesis consists on the usage of many
"grains" of sounds. Grains may vary a lot on the waveform they carry, but
they have a short duration and generally an envelope is applied on their
amplitude. The occurance of each &lt;em&gt;microsound&lt;/em&gt; can be regarded as an event, and
the addition of many of these events can produce an overall effect which is
metaphorically tied to a &lt;em&gt;cloud&lt;/em&gt;, as named by Curtis Roads. This comparasion is
very useful as it binds emergent characteristics of this group of events, such
as density, with a natural phenomenon widely known.  Methods have been proposed
to control the overall behavior of this clouds, being the statistical approach
the first one and most &lt;em&gt;classical&lt;/em&gt; (it's usage can be traced back to Xenakis'
piece &lt;em&gt;Metastasis&lt;/em&gt; and it is the main topic of &lt;em&gt;Musiques Formelles&lt;/em&gt;). Other
implementations can be described as algorithmic or processual, such as Eduardo
Reck Miranda's &lt;em&gt;ChaosSynth&lt;/em&gt;, a synth which employs a cellular automaton as a
means of sequencing the density and pitch of grains. 
With the advent of information technologies applied to extracting meaningful
information from sound a new dimension for grain sequencing is conceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History and taxonomy of Corpus Based Concatenative Synthesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diemo
&lt;a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01161401/"&gt;Schwarz(2006)&lt;/a&gt;[@schwarz2006concatenative]
traces an historical account of this kind of synthesis, from early usages to
modern day implementations, as he proposes a taxonomy for the "approaches to
musical sound synthesis that are somehow data-driven and concatenative". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He points out the processes of selection and manipulation with the advent of
&lt;em&gt;musique concrete&lt;/em&gt; and early electronic music as the first experimentations
which can be bound to this kind of synthesis.  Pierre Schaeffer's &lt;em&gt;Groupe de
Recherche Musical (GRM)&lt;/em&gt; handcrafted edition, selection and manipulation of
tapes along with the concept of &lt;em&gt;sound object&lt;/em&gt; can be seen as pioneering
landmarks. Other pieces of composers such as Xenakis' &lt;em&gt;Analogique A et
B&lt;/em&gt;(1958/59), Cage's &lt;em&gt;William Mix&lt;/em&gt;(1953), Stockhausen's &lt;em&gt;Etude&lt;/em&gt;(1952) and John
Oswald's &lt;em&gt;Plunderphonics&lt;/em&gt; would also correspond to the group named "Manual
Approach".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author sorts different approaches for the implementations of concatenative
synthesis according to the strategies used regarding sound analysis and
selection. He establishes the following taxonomy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manual approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed mapping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spectral frame similarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Segmental similarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Descriptor analysis with direct selection in real time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-level descriptors for targeted stochastic selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Descriptor analysis with fully automatic high-level unit selection &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not go into further detail as to what any other group stands for, but
note that they target more modern usages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a different publication,
&lt;a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01161401/"&gt;Schwarz(2008)&lt;/a&gt; proposes
another taxonomy, this time aiming to describe "new musical ideas to be
experimented by the novel concepts [concatenative synthesis] proposes". These are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-arranging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interaction with self-recorded sound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Composition by navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-selection and interpolation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corpus based selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I will not explain the meaning of each category, but the implementation
I developed would be part of the Re-arranging group, where "units from the
corpus are re-arranged by other rules than the temporal order of their original
recordings".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Implementation of corpus based concatenative synthesis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sound analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audio analysis tools are capable of retrieving a great amount of data from
audio files.  This kind of information retrieval techniques is a subset of a
much larger, much complex field of study known as music information retrieval
(MIR). In order to depict sound, lots of different aspects are numerically
measured.  These aspects are called &lt;em&gt;features&lt;/em&gt; and they can describe sound in
different levels. Those features which are more closely related to signal
processing and that can be represented by numerical values are called low level
features. They commonly refer to spectral analysis, MFCC bands analysis, etc.
They are obtained through the analyisis of a given number of samples, called
analysis windows, whose size is a power of two (2048, 4096) due to
computational efficiency. High level features describe sound in a more
semantical manner. They are related to musical aspects such as genre and
mood. High level features emerge from processing low level features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the short time span of grains, low level features seem as the obvious
choice for the processing stage of data driven granular synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Towards an implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are existing implementations of this technique on popular audio
programming platforms, such as Pure Data, MaxMSP and SuperCollider. One of the
key concepts of this kind of synthesis technique is the close relation it bears 
between information technologies and sound design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present work proposes an implementation using Python, which is a
programming language that has a lot of powerful libraries developed to perform
feature extraction, data analysis, data visualisation, machine learning. As a
high level programming language it is not the best choice for real time audio
manipulation. Nevertheless, it can be used to perform some basic audio tasks such
as writing to an audio buffer with a callback function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Audio analysis tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to implement a data-driven sound design technique is to create a
data base of audio analysis information. There is a wide variety of audio
analysis tools, for example &lt;a href="http://librosa.github.io/"&gt;librosa&lt;/a&gt;, which is a
library for audio and music processing on Python.
&lt;a href="https://essentia.upf.edu/"&gt;Essentia&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source C++ library with Python
bindings for audio analysis and audio-based music information retrieval, is
another great option due to the extensive amount of audio features it extracts.
The Essentia library performs an exhaustive analysis, so a script was made to
filter the output, that is, keeping the information of low level features only.
The data obtained was later stored on files using the csv format. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data driven granular synthesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As windowing techniques used for spectral analysis overlap consecutive analysis
windows to obtain a more accurate result, so do the most common sound grain
concatenation techniques to avoid harsh sound ripples or artifacts. In the
former case, the overlapping would be between grains. This solves a problem
from the start, as grain overlapping can be matched with the overlapping of
analysis windows. The size of grains is also an important part of the outcome
of the resulting sound. After experimenting different window sizes, it could be
pointed out that using smaller grains for concatenation - again, always fixed
to the size of the analysis window - would render a more abstract sound.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, a decision was made concerning the sound sources and the desired
result, that is, not only to bind the sound design process to a sound 
synthesis technique, but also to aim for a sonification of the information
obtained. This would lead to the final result, basically sorting sound in a
microsound level according to values gathered during the analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a Linux user, you can download the application featured on the video
above &lt;a href="https://github.com/ioadeer/audioplayer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In order to use the
synth, you will have to download a group of audio files and the data set
obtained from them. The github repo also contains a script which allows you
create analysis files from wav files.&lt;/p&gt;
